## Analysis of Algorithms Project
### Project Members
* George Guillford
* Carlos Villegas
* Carlos Murillo
### Project Goal
* Analyzing the run time of a program that implements multiple algorithms to compare a word against a wordlist
### Levenshtein Distance Equation
* Levenshtein distance equation is one of the major alogrithms used in this project.
  * The Levenshtein distance calculates the difference from one word to another using simple operations on characters like add, delete, replace
  * The algorithm returns a value that will give you the difference between one word and another
### Trie Data Structure
* Trie data structure used to parse the words in the dictionary and the word whose spelling is being checked
  * Using the levenshtein distance, we are able to return words within a certain levenshtein distance of the misspelled word
